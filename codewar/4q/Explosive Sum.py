How many ways can you make the sum of a number?
In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n,
also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers.
Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition.
If order matters, the sum becomes a composition. For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:

number = 5
number_list = [1]*number
